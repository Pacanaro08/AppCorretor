This personal project was solely aimed at creating a CRUD system to facilitate my father's work as a real estate broker. It is based on the insertion of various types of property data, including owner data, house details, and images. It was programmed in Java using Android Studio and SQLite was used for data insertion, allowing for the application to be used without the need for internet, servers, and Docker for proper functioning.
